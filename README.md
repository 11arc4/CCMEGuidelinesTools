#CCMEGuidelinesTools

This package aims to provide (relatively) easy to use functions to support the comparison of GNWT water quality and sediment data to CCME Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. 

Functions are current developed to be flexible and support multiple data inputs but requires users to choose what to compare. We may make this more automatic and easier to use going forward.
